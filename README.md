# CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
A Python program that makes it easy to manage modules on a CircuitPython device!

Run `main.py` to start the program. Make sure that `bundle_tools` is in the same directory!
Note: This will create a bunch of files and directories so I recommend placing this in a separate directory and adding a shortcut or a symlink.
