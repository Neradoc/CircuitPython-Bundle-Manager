# CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager
A Python program that makes it easy to manage modules on a CircuitPython device!

Run `main.py` to start the program. Make sure that [`bundle_tools`](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/tree/main/bundle_tools) is in the same directory and that all [requirements](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/CircuitPython-Bundle-Manager/blob/main/requirements.txt) are met!
Note: This will create a bunch of files and directories, so I recommend placing this in its own directory and adding a shortcut or a symlink to the desktop or something like that.

**I'M NOT RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS CAUSED BY USING THIS TOOL.** (But please report any bugs!ðŸ˜ƒ)
